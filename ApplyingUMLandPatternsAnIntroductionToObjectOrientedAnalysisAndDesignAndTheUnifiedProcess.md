## 0. Foreward

* Programming: Analysis and design, defining how to solve the problem, what to program, capturing this design in ways that are easy to communicate, to review, to implement, and to evolve is what lies at the core of this book.
* Patterns give a name and form to abstract heuristics, rules and best practices of object oriented techniques.

## 1. Object Oriented Analysis and Design

### 1.1 Applying UML and Patterns in OOA/D

* Owning a hammer doesn't make one an architect. Knowing an object-oriented language is a necessary but insufficient first step to create object systems.
* Patterns: Named problem-solution formulas that codify exemplary design principles.

### 1.2 Assigning Responsibilities

* A critical, fundamental ability in OOA/D is to skillfully assign responsibilities to software components.
    * It strongly influences the robustness, maintainability and reusability.
    * On a real project, a developer might not have the opportunity to perform any other analysis or design activities - the "rush to code" development process. Yet even in this situation, assigning responsibilities is inevitable.

### 1.3 What is analysis and design

* Analysis emphasizes an investigation of the problem and requirements, rather than a solution.
* Design emphasizes a conceptual solution that fulfills the requirements, rather that its implementation. Ultimately, designs can be implemented.
* Do the right thing (analysis), and do the thing right (design).

### 1.4 What is Object-Oriented Analysis and Design?

* During OOA, there is an emphasis on finding and describing the objects -or concepts- in the problem domain.
* During OOD, there is an emphasis on defining software objects and how they collaborate to fulfill the requirements.
* During object-oriented programming, design objects are implemented.

### 1.5 An example

* A dice game, in which a player rolls two die. If the total is seven, they win; otherwise, they lose.

#### Define Use Cases

* Use cases are not object-oriented artifacts - They are simply written stories

#### Define a Domain Model

* A decomposition of the domain involves an identification of the concepts, attributes and associations that are considered noteworthy. The result is ilustrated in a set of diagrams that show domain concepts or objects.
* A domain model is not a description o software objects, it is a visualization of concepts in the real-world domain.

#### Define Interaction Diagrams.

* A common notation to illustrate software objects and their collaborations is the interaction diagram. It show the flow of messages between software objects, and thus the invocation of methods.
* Software object designs and programs do take some inspiration from real-world domains, but they are not direct models or simulations of the real world.

#### Define Design Class Diagrams

* An inspection of the interaction diagram leads to a partial design class.
* In contrast to the domain model, this diagram does not illustrate real-world concepts; rather, it shows software classes.

### 1.6 The UML

* The Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a language for specifying, visualizing, constructing, and documenting the artifacts of software systems, as well as for business modeling and other non-software systems.
