## 1. Welcome to Software Construction

* Software construction is the central activity in software development; construction is the only activity that's guaranteed to happen on every project.
* The main activities in construction are detailed design, coding, debugging, integration, and developer testing (unit testing and integration testing).
* Other common terms for construction are "coding" and "programming".
* The quality of the construction substantially affects the quality of the software.
* In the final analysis, your understanding of how to do construction determines how good a programmer you are, and that's the subject of the rest of the book.

## 2. Metaphors for a Richer Understanding of Software Development

* Metaphors are heuristics, not algorithms. As such, they tend to be a little sloppy.
* Metaphors help you understand the software-development process by relating it to other activities you already know about.
* Some metaphors are better that others.
* Treating software construction as similar to building construction suggests that careful preparation is needed and illuminates the difference between large and small projects.
* Thinking of software-development practices as tools in an intellectual toolbox suggests further that every programmer has many tools and that no signle tool is right for every job. Choosing the right tool for each problem is one key to being an effective programmer.
* Metaphors are not mutually exclusive. Use the combination of metaphors that works best for you.
