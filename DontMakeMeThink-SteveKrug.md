## 1. Don't Make me Think

* The most important think I should do to make sure my site is easy to use is "Don't make me think".

### Things that make us think

* **Bad names:** cute or clever names, marketing-induced names, company-specific names and unfamiliar technical names.
* There's always a plausible rationale behind every usability flaw.
* **Links and buttons that aren't obviously clickable**.
* Every question mark adds to our cognitive workload, distracting our attention from the task at hand.
* No question marks. No mental chatter and no errors.
* Users shouldn't spend their time thinking about:
    * Where am I?
    * Where should I begin?
    * Where did they put ___?
    * What are the most important things on this page?
    * Why did they call it that?
    * Is that an add or part of the site>

### You can't make everything self-evident.

* Your goal should be for each page to be self evident, so that just by looking at it the average user will know what it is and how to use it.
* Sometimes, if you're doing something that's inheritly complicated, you hoave to settle for self-explanatory: it requires a little thought to "get it" but only a little.

### Why is all of this important?

* Using a site that doesn't make us think about unimportant thinkgs feels effortless, whereas puzzling over things that don't matter to us tends to sap our energy and enthusiasm and time.

## 2. How we really  use the web: Scanning, Satisficing, and muddling through.

* People will not pore each page, reading all of our carefullyl crafted test, figuring out how we've organized things and weighing their options before deciding which link to click.
* What they actually do is glance at each new page, scan some of the text, and click on the first link that catches their interest or vaguely resembles the thing their working for.
    * There are almost always large parts of the page that they don't even look at.

### Fact of life #1: We don't read pages, we scan them.

* People teng to spend very little time reading most web pages. Instead, we scan (or skim) them, looking for words or phrases that catch our eye.
* Why do we scan?
    * We're usually on a mission.
    * We know we don't need to read everything.
    * We are good at it.
* We focus on words and phrases that seem to match (a) the task at hard or (b) our current or ongoing personal interests. And of course, (c) the trigger words that are hardwire into our brains: "Free", "Sale", "Sex", and our own name.

### Fact of life #2: We don't make optimal choices. We satisfice.

* We don't choose the best option - we choose the first reasonable option, a strategy known as satisficing. As soon as we find a link that seems like it might lead to what we're looking for, there's a very good chance that we'll click it.

* Why don't web users look for the best choice?
    * We're in a hurry.
    * There's not much of a penaly for guessing wrong.
    * Weighing options may not improve our chances.
    * Guessing is more fun.

### Fact of life #3: We don't figure out how things work. We muddle through.

* People use things all the time without understanding how they work or with completly wrong-headed ideas about how they work.
* Very few people take the time to read instructioins.
* Why does this happen?
    * **It's not important to us:** For most of us, it doesn't matter to us whether we understand how things work.
    * If we find something that works, we stick to it.
* "Muddle through" tends to be inefficient and error prone.
* When users "get it":
    * There's a much better chance that they'll find what they're looking for.
    * There's a better change that they'll understand the full range or what your site has to offer.
    * They'll feel smarter and more in control when they're using your site, which will bring them back.

## 3. Billboard Design 101: Designing for Scanning, not Reading.

* There are some things youo can do to make sure your users see and understand as much of what they need to know - and of what you want them to know.
    * Take advantage of conventions
    * Create effective visual hierarchies
    * Break pages up into clearly defined areas.
    * Make it obvious what's clickable
    * Eliminate distractions
    * Format content to support scanning.

### Conventions are your friends

* One way to make anything easier in a hurry, is to follow the existing conventions - the widely used or standardized design patterns.
* Many conventions for web pages have evolved.
* Where things will be located on a page.
    * Logo identifying the site to be in the top left corner.
    * Primary navigation to be across the top or down to the left side.
* How things work.
    * All sites that sell products use the metaphor of a shopping cart.
* How things look
    * Links
    * Search icon
    * Social networking sharing options.
* There's a great temptation for designers to try reinventing the wheel instead, largely because they feel that the've been hired to do something new and different, not the same old thing.
* If you're not going to use an exising web convention, you need to be sure that what you're replacing it with either
    * a) is so clear and self-explanatory that there's non leaerning curve - so it's as good as the convention or
    * b) adds so much value that it's worth a small learning curve.
* You can -and should- be as creative and innovative as you want and add as much aesthetical appeal as you can, as long as you make sure it's still usable.

### Create effective visual hierarchies

* Make sure that the appearance of the things on the page accurately portray the relationships between the things on the page.
    * Which things are more important
    * Which things are similar
    * Which things are part of other things.
* The more important something is, the more prominent it is.
    * The most important elements are either larger, bolder, in a distinctive color, so on.
* Things that are related logically are related visually.
    * Put them all in a clearly defined area.
    * Use the same visual style.
* Things are "nested" visually to show what's part of what.
    * A site section name would appear above the titles of the individual articles.
* A good visual hierarchy saves us work by preprocessing the page for us, organizing and prioritizing its contents in a way that we can grasp almost instantly.

### Break up pages into clearly defined areas

* Dividing the page into clearly defined areas is important because it allows users to decide quickly which areas of the page to focus on, and which areas they can safely ignore.

### Make it obvious what's clickable

* As we scan a page, we're looking for a variety of visual cues that identify things as clickable (or "tapable" on touch screens) - things like shape (buttons, tabs, etc), location (in ia menu bar, for instance) and formatting (color and underlining).

### Keep the noise down to a dull roar

* One of the great enemies of easy-to-grasp pages is visual noise.
* There are three kinds of noise:
    * **Shouting:** When everything on the page is clamoring for your attention, the effect can be overwhelming. Shouting is the result of a failure to make tough decisions about which elements are really the most important and then create a visual hierarchy that guides users to them first.
    * **Disorganization:** The designer doesn't understand the importance of using grids to align the elements on a page.
    * **Clutter:** We've seem pages (especially home pages) that just have too much stuff. Assume that everything is visual noise and get rid of anything that's not making a real contribution.

### Format Text to Support Scanning

* Use plenty of headings
    * Headings work as a table of contents for a page. They tell you what each section is about and help you dcide which parts to read, scan or skip.
    * Make sure your heading are closer to the section they introduce than to the section they follow.
* Keep paragraphs short.
* Use bulleted lists.
    * There should be a small amount of additional space between the items in the list.
* Highlight key terms.
    * Formatting the most important key words in bold makes them easier to find.
    * Don't highlight too  many things, though, or the technique will lose its effectiveness.

## 4. Animal, Vegetable, or mineral? Why users like mindless choices.

* What really counts is not the number of clicks it takes me to get to what I want (although there are limits), but rather how hard each click is - the amount of thought required and the amount of uncertainty about whether I'm making the right choice.
* Users don't mind a lot of clicks as long as each click is painless and they have continued confidence that they're on the right track.

### Some assistance may be required

* When you can't avoid giving me a difficult choice, you need to go out your way to give me as much guidance as I need - but no more.
    * **Brief:** The smallest amount of information that will help me.
    * **Timely:** Placed so I encounter it exactly when I need it.
    * **Unavoidable:** Formatted in a way that ensures that I'll notice it.

## 5. Omit needless words. The art of not writing for the web.

* I have no trouble getting rid of half the words on most web pages without losing anything of value.
* Getting rid of the unnecessary words has several beneficial effects:
    * It reduces the noise level of the page
    * It makes the useful content more prominent
    * It makes the pages shorter, allowing users to see more of each page at a glance without scrolling..

### Happy talk must die

* Happy talk conveys no useful information, and focuses on saying how great we are, as opposed to explaining what makes us great.
* Most web users don't have time for small talk; they want to get right to the point. You should eliminate as much happy talk as possible.

### Instructions must die

* Your objective should always be to eliminate instructions entirely by making everything self explanatory, or as close to it as possible.
* When instructions are absolutely necessary, cut them back to the bare minimum.

## 6. Street signs and Bread crumbs. Designing Navigation.

* People won't use your Web site if they can't find their way around it.

### Web Navigation 101

* You're usually trying to find something.
* You decide whether to ask first or browse first.
    * On a web site there's no one standing around who can tell you where things are.
    * The web equivalent of asking directions is searching.
* If you choose to browse, you make your way through a hierarchy using signs to guide you.
    * Look around on the Home Page for a list of the site's main sections and click on the one that seems right.
* Eventually, if you can't find what you're looking for, you'll leave.

### The unbearable lightness of browsing.

* We teng to have very little sense of how big a website is.
    * It's hard to know whether you've seen everything of interest to you in a site.
    * It's hard to know when to stop looking.
* In a web site, there's no left and right, no up and down.
* In physical spaces, as we move around, we accumulate knowledge about the space. We develop a sense of where things are and can take shortcuts to get to them.
    * On the web we are teleported. When we want to return, instead of relying on the physical sense of where it is, we have to remember the conceptual hierarchy and retrace our steps.
    * Web navigation compensates for the missing sense of place by embodying the sites hierarchy, creating a sense of "there".

### The overlooked purposes of navigation

* Navigation help us find whatever it is we're looking for.
* Navigation tells us where we are.
* It tells us what's here.
    * Navigation reveals content.
* It tells us how to use the site.
    * Where to begin and what your options are.
* It gives us confidence in the people who built it.

### Web navigation conventions

* Conventions specify (loosely) the appearance and location of navigation elements so we know what to look for and where to look when we need them.
    * Putting them in a standard place lets us locate them quickly.
    * Standardizing their appearance makes it easy to distinguish them from everything else.
* Some basic navigation conventions for the web.
    * SiteID: Top left corner.
    * Utilities: Top right corner.
    * Sections in a top bar.
    * Selected section in a different color.
    * Footer navigation.
    * Local navigation (things at the current level) at the left side.

### Don't look now, but I think it's following us.

* Persistent navigation: Set of Navigationo elements that appear on every page of a site.
* "The navigation is over here. Some parts will change a little depending on where you are, but it will always be here, and it will always work the same way".
* Persistent navigation should include the four elements you most need to have on hand at all times:
    1. SiteID
    2. Utilities
    3. Sections.
    4. Search.

### Did I say every page?

* Forms is the one exception to the "follow me everywhere" rule.
* Where a form needs to be filled in, the persistent navigation can sometimes be an unnecessary distraction.
* When I'm paying for my purchase on an i-commer site, you don't really want me to do anything but finish filling in the form.
* It's usuful to have a minimal ersion of the persistent navigation.

### Now I know we're not in Kansas

* I need to see the siteId on every page, at the top of the page - usually in the upper left corner.
* To get the siteID prominent across in the visual hierarchy of the page, it must frame everything else.
* It should have a distinctive typeface and a graphic that's recognizable at any size from a button to a billboard.

### The Sections

* Primary navigation: Links to the main sections of the site.
* Secondary navigation: List of subsections in the current section.

### The Utilities

* Utilities are the links to important elements of the site that aren't really part of the content hierarchy.
* Utilities list should be slightly less prominent than the sections.
* The persistent navigation can accomodate only four or five utilities - the ones that users are likely to need most often.
* The less frequently used leftovers belong in the footer.

### Just click your heels three times and say: "There's no place like home"

* Web users expect the siteId to be a button that can take you to the Home Page.
* Home hsould be included with the main sections of the site.

### A way to search

* Unless your site is very small and very well organized, every page should have either a search box or a link to a search page.
* Avoid
    * **Fancy wording:** Users will look for the word "search", so use that word instead of "Find".
    * **Instructions:** Is not necessary to write "Type a keyword".
    * **Options:** If there is any possibility of confusion about the scope of search (what's being searched, the site, a book, an author, the section), by all mleans spell it our.

### Secondary, tertrary, and whatever comes after tertrary.

* It's acutally hard to find good examples of third-level navigations.
* Users end up spending as much time on lower level pages as they do at the top. And, unless you've worked out top-to-bottom navigation from the beginning, it's very hard to fragg it on later and come up with something consistent.
* It's vital to have sample pages that show the navigation for all the potential levels of the site before you start arguing about the color scheme.

### Page Names, or Why I love to drive in L.A.

* Every page needs a name
    * Despite having highlighted the name in the navigation, you need to write the name of the page in the page, too.
* The name needs to be in the right place.
    * It should appear framing the content that's unique to the page: it's naming the page, not the navigation or the adds.
* The name needs to be prominent.
* The name needs to match what I clicked.

### You are here.

* One way to counteract the web's intent "lost in space" feeling is by showing me where I am in the scheme of things, by highlighting my current location in whatever navigation bars, list or menus appear on the pageg.
* "You are here" indicators need to stand out; if they don't, they lose their value and just add more noise to the page.
* Web users are generally in such a hurry that they routinely miss subtle cues.

### Bread crumbs.

* Breadcrumbs show you the bath from the Home page to where you are and make it easy to move back up to higher levels in the hierarchy of a site.
* Done right, Breadcrumbs are a self-explanatory, consistent way to back up a level or go Home.
* Put them at the top.
* Use `>` between levels.
* Boldface the last item.
    * Because it's the page that you're on, naturally it's not a link.

### Three reasons why I still love tabs.

* Tabs divide whatever they're sticking out of into sections, and they make it easy to open a section by reaching for its tab.
* They are self-evident.
* They are hard to miss
    * They create the kind of obvious-at-a-glance division you want between navigation and content.
* Tabs are slick.
    * Tabs can add polish and can make pages more visual interesting.
* For tabs to work to ffull effect, the graphics have to create the visual illusion othat the active tab is in front of the other tabs.
* The active tab needs to be a different color, and it has to physically connect with the space below it.

### Try the trunk test

* If the page is well designed, you should be able to answer these questions.
    * What site is this? (siteId)
    * What page am I on? (page name)
    * What are the major sections of this site? (sections)
    * What are my options at this level? (local navigation)
    * Where am I in the scheme of things? (You are here).
    * How can I seach?
* Users are often dropped down in the middle of a site with no idea where we are because we've followed a link from a searching engine, a social networking site, etc.

## 7. The Big Bang theory of web design.

* Things that Home Page has to accomodate:
    * Site identity and mission:
        * What is this site?
        * What is it for?
        * Why should I be here and not at some other site?
    * Site hierarchy: (Handled by the persistent navigation)
        * What can I find here? (content)
        * What can I do here? (features)
    * Search box
    * Teases: Hints of the good stuff inside
        * Content promos: Spotlight the newest, best or most popular pieces of content.
        * Feature promos: Invite me to explore sections of the site.
    * Deals:
        * Home Page has to allocate some advertisement for co-branding deals ever made.
    * Shortcuts: The most frequently requested pieces of content may deserve their own links on the Home Page.
    * Registration: The home page needs links for new users to register, and old users to sign in, and a way to let me know that I'm signed in.
    * The Home Page has to meet a few abstract objectives:
        * Show me what I'm looking for: Make it obvious how to get whatever I want.
        * Show me where to start.
        * Establish credibility and trust: For some visitors, the HomePage is the only chance to create a good impression.

### And you have to do it Blind Folded

* Some usual constraints:
    * Everybody wants a piece of it: since it's likely to be the page seen by most visitors, things that are prominently promoted on the Home Page tend to get significantly greated traffic.
    * Too many cooks: Everybody has an opinion about the HomePage.
    * One size fits all: Home Page has to appeal to everyone who visits the site.

### The First Casualty of War

* Whenever someone hands me a Home Page design to look at, there's one thing I can almost always count on: They haven't made it clear enough what the site is.
    * What is this site?
    * What do they have here?
    * What can I do here?
    * Why should I be here and not somewhere else?
* The first 5 seconds you spend on a new web site or web page are critical.
    * If I get it, I'm likely to correctly interpret everything I see, which improves my chances of having a satisfying experience.
* The first 5 seconds, initial impressions tend to be very similar to the impressions people have after they actually have a chance to spend time on the page.
    * If their first assumptions are wrong ("This is a site for `X`"), they begin to try to force-fit that explanation on to everything they encounter. If it's wrong, they'll end up creating more miss-interpretations.
* Top 4 plausible excuses for not spelling out the big picture on the HomePage.
    * When you're too involved in building a website, you think that what you're offering is obvious to everybody.
    * Most of the people will not get annoyed when they see the same explantion of something everytime they go there.
    * It's tempting to think that people who don't "get" your site right away probably aren't your real audience, but it's not true.
    * People must get the big picture by getting caught by the big picture itself, not by the advertisement.

### But... the Home Page? Really?

* Since every body are likely to enter to your site by clickiing on a link in an email, a blog, or something from a social network; every page of your site should do as much as it can do to orient them properly.
    * Who you are.
    * What you do.
    * What your site has to offer.

### How to get the message accross.
