## 1. Don't Make me Think

* The most important think I should do to make sure my site is easy to use is "Don't make me think".

### Things that make us think

* **Bad names:** cute or clever names, marketing-induced names, company-specific names and unfamiliar technical names.
* There's always a plausible rationale behind every usability flaw.
* **Links and buttons that aren't obviously clickable**.
* Every question mark adds to our cognitive workload, distracting our attention from the task at hand.
* No question marks. No mental chatter and no errors.
* Users shouldn't spend their time thinking about:
    * Where am I?
    * Where should I begin?
    * Where did they put ___?
    * What are the most important things on this page?
    * Why did they call it that?
    * Is that an add or part of the site>

### You can't make everything self-evident.

* Your goal should be for each page to be self evident, so that just by looking at it the average user will know what it is and how to use it.
* Sometimes, if you're doing something that's inheritly complicated, you hoave to settle for self-explanatory: it requires a little thought to "get it" but only a little.

### Why is all of this important?

* Using a site that doesn't make us think about unimportant thinkgs feels effortless, whereas puzzling over things that don't matter to us tends to sap our energy and enthusiasm and time.

## 2. How we really  use the web: Scanning, Satisficing, and muddling through.

* People will not pore each page, reading all of our carefullyl crafted test, figuring out how we've organized things and weighing their options before deciding which link to click.
* What they actually do is glance at each new page, scan some of the text, and click on the first link that catches their interest or vaguely resembles the thing their working for.
    * There are almost always large parts of the page that they don't even look at.

### Fact of life #1: We don't read pages, we scan them.

* People teng to spend very little time reading most web pages. Instead, we scan (or skim) them, looking for words or phrases that catch our eye.
* Why do we scan?
    * We're usually on a mission.
    * We know we don't need to read everything.
    * We are good at it.
* We focus on words and phrases that seem to match (a) the task at hard or (b) our current or ongoing personal interests. And of course, (c) the trigger words that are hardwire into our brains: "Free", "Sale", "Sex", and our own name.

### Fact of life #2: We don't make optimal choices. We satisfice.

* We don't choose the best option - we choose the first reasonable option, a strategy known as satisficing. As soon as we find a link that seems like it might lead to what we're looking for, there's a very good chance that we'll click it.

* Why don't web users look for the best choice?
    * We're in a hurry.
    * There's not much of a penaly for guessing wrong.
    * Weighing options may not improve our chances.
    * Guessing is more fun.

### Fact of life #3: We don't figure out how things work. We muddle through.

* People use things all the time without understanding how they work or with completly wrong-headed ideas about how they work.
* Very few people take the time to read instructioins.
* Why does this happen?
    * **It's not important to us:** For most of us, it doesn't matter to us whether we understand how things work.
    * If we find something that works, we stick to it.
* "Muddle through" tends to be inefficient and error prone.
* When users "get it":
    * There's a much better chance that they'll find what they're looking for.
    * There's a better change that they'll understand the full range or what your site has to offer.
    * They'll feel smarter and more in control when they're using your site, which will bring them back.

## 3. Billboard Design 101: Designing for Scanning, not Reading.

* There are some things youo can do to make sure your users see and understand as much of what they need to know - and of what you want them to know.
    * Take advantage of conventions
    * Create effective visual hierarchies
    * Break pages up into clearly defined areas.
    * Make it obvious what's clickable
    * Eliminate distractions
    * Format content to support scanning.

### Conventions are your friends

* One way to make anything easier in a hurry, is to follow the existing conventions - the widely used or standardized design patterns.
* Many conventions for web pages have evolved.
* Where things will be located on a page.
    * Logo identifying the site to be in the top left corner.
    * Primary navigation to be across the top or down to the left side.
* How things work.
    * All sites that sell products use the metaphor of a shopping cart.
* How things look
    * Links
    * Search icon
    * Social networking sharing options.
* There's a great temptation for designers to try reinventing the wheel instead, largely because they feel that the've been hired to do something new and different, not the same old thing.
* If you're not going to use an exising web convention, you need to be sure that what you're replacing it with either
    * a) is so clear and self-explanatory that there's non leaerning curve - so it's as good as the convention or
    * b) adds so much value that it's worth a small learning curve.
* You can -and should- be as creative and innovative as you want and add as much aesthetical appeal as you can, as long as you make sure it's still usable.

### Create effective visual hierarchies

* Make sure that the appearance of the things on the page accurately portray the relationships between the things on the page.
    * Which things are more important
    * Which things are similar
    * Which things are part of other things.
* The more important something is, the more prominent it is.
    * The most important elements are either larger, bolder, in a distinctive color, so on.
* Things that are related logically are related visually.
    * Put them all in a clearly defined area.
    * Use the same visual style.
* Things are "nested" visually to show what's part of what.
    * A site section name would appear above the titles of the individual articles.
* A good visual hierarchy saves us work by preprocessing the page for us, organizing and prioritizing its contents in a way that we can grasp almost instantly.

### Break up pages into clearly defined areas

* Dividing the page into clearly defined areas is important because it allows users to decide quickly which areas of the page to focus on, and which areas they can safely ignore.

### Make it obvious what's clickable

* As we scan a page, we're looking for a variety of visual cues that identify things as clickable (or "tapable" on touch screens) - things like shape (buttons, tabs, etc), location (in ia menu bar, for instance) and formatting (color and underlining).

### Keep the noise down to a dull roar

* One of the great enemies of easy-to-grasp pages is visual noise.
* There are three kinds of noise:
    * **Shouting:** When everything on the page is clamoring for your attention, the effect can be overwhelming. Shouting is the result of a failure to make tough decisions about which elements are really the most important and then create a visual hierarchy that guides users to them first.
    * **Disorganization:** The designer doesn't understand the importance of using grids to align the elements on a page.
    * **Clutter:** We've seem pages (especially home pages) that just have too much stuff. Assume that everything is visual noise and get rid of anything that's not making a real contribution.

### Format Text to Support Scanning

* Use plenty of headings
    * Headings work as a table of contents for a page. They tell you what each section is about and help you dcide which parts to read, scan or skip.
    * Make sure your heading are closer to the section they introduce than to the section they follow.
* Keep paragraphs short.
* Use bulleted lists.
    * There should be a small amount of additional space between the items in the list.
* Highlight key terms.
    * Formatting the most important key words in bold makes them easier to find.
    * Don't highlight too  many things, though, or the technique will lose its effectiveness.

## 4. Animal, Vegetable, or mineral? Why users like mindless choices.

* What really counts is not the number of clicks it takes me to get to what I want (although there are limits), but rather how hard each click is - the amount of thought required and the amount of uncertainty about whether I'm making the right choice.
* Users don't mind a lot of clicks as long as each click is painless and they have continued confidence that they're on the right track.

### Some assistance may be required

* When you can't avoid giving me a difficult choice, you need to go out your way to give me as much guidance as I need - but no more.
    * **Brief:** The smallest amount of information that will help me.
    * **Timely:** Placed so I encounter it exactly when I need it.
    * **Unavoidable:** Formatted in a way that ensures that I'll notice it.

## 5. Omit needless words. The art of not writing for the web.

* I have no trouble getting rid of half the words on most web pages without losing anything of value.
* Getting rid of the unnecessary words has several beneficial effects:
    * It reduces the noise level of the page
    * It makes the useful content more prominent
    * It makes the pages shorter, allowing users to see more of each page at a glance without scrolling..

### Happy talk must die

* Happy talk conveys no useful information, and focuses on saying how great we are, as opposed to explaining what makes us great.
* Most web users don't have time for small talk; they want to get right to the point. You should eliminate as much happy talk as possible.

### Instructions must die

* Your objective should always be to eliminate instructions entirely by making everything self explanatory, or as close to it as possible.
* When instructions are absolutely necessary, cut them back to the bare minimum.
