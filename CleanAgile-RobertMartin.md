## 1. Introduction to Agile

* In febreuary 2001, a group of 17 software experts gathered in Snowbird, Utah, to create a manifesto that introduced a more effective, lighter-weight, approach to develop software.
* Once a movement becomes popular, the name of that movement gets blurred through missunderstanding and usurpation.

### History of Agile

* The idea of choosing small intermediate goals and measuring the progress, after each is just too intuitive, and too human, to be considered any kind of a revolution.
* In "scientific management", managers use scientific techniques to ascertain the best procedures for accomplishing a goal and then direct all subordinates to follow their plan to the letter. There is a big up-front planning followed by careful detailed implementation.
* Pro-Agile took short reactive steps that were measured and refined in order to stagger, in a direct random walk, toward a good outcome.
* Scientific management deferred action until a thoroung analysis and resulting detailed plan had been created.
* Pre-agile worked well for projects that enjoyed a low cost of chnage, and solved partially defined projects with informally specified goals.
* Scientific management worked best for projects that suffered a high cost of change and solve very well-defined problems with extremely specific goals.
* Waterfall was a logical descendant of scientific management. It was all about doing a thorough analysis, making a detailed plan, and then executing the plan to completion.
* Waterfall began to dominate the way we thought.
* It dominated, but it didn't work. For the next thirty years, we tried to get that analysis and design right. But everytime we thought we had it, it slipped through our fingers during the implementation phase. All our months of careful planning were made irrelevant by the inveitable mod dash.
* How could we thoroughly analyzing the problem, carefully designing a solution, and then implmenting that design, fail so spectacularly over and over again? It was inconceivable that the problem lay in the strategy. It had to lie with us.
* Agile manifesto:
    * **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools.
    * **Working software** over comprehensive documentation.
    * **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation.
    * **Responding to change** over following a plan.

### Agile Overview

* how do you manage a sotware projects?
    * Hope and prayer
    * Those who don't have faith, often fall back on motivational techniques such as enforcing dates with whips, chains, boiling oil, and pictures of people climbing rocks and seagulls flying over the ocean.
* These approaches almost universally lead to the characteristic symptoms of software management:
    * Development teams who are always late despite working too much overtime.
    * Teams who produce products of poor quality that don't come close to meeting the needs of the customer.

### The Iron Cross

* The fundamental physics of software projects, contraints all projects to obey an unssailable trade off called the Iron Cross of project management: Good, Fast, Cheap and Done: Pick any three you like. You can't have the fourth.

* A good manager manages the coefficients on these attributes rather than demanding that all those coefficients are 100%.

### Charts on the wall

* Agile provides data. An agile development team produces just the kinds of data that managers need in order to make good decisions.
* The velocity graph shows how much the development teams has gotten done every week.
* The burndown chart shows how many points remain until the next major millestone. Notice how it declines each week. Note that it declines less than the number of points in the velocity chart. This is because there is a constant background of new requirements and issues being discovered during development.
* note that you can find glitches on the burn-down chart. They might have been due to the addition of some new features or some other major changes to the requirements. Or it might have been the result of developers re-estimating the remaining work.
* Agile development is first and foremost a feedback-driven approach.
* Without data, the project cannot bee managed.
* Make sure that managers know how fast the team is moving and how much the team has left to accomplish. And present this information in a transparent, public and obvious fashion.

### The first think you know

* The first thing you know about a project is *The Date*. Once *The Date* is chosen, the date is frozen. There's no point trying to regotiate the date, because the date was chosen for good business reasons.
* Whatever the reason, it's a good gusiness reason, and it's not going to change just because some developers think they might not be able to make it.
* At the same time, the requirements are wildly in flux and can never be frozen. The requirements are constantly being re-evaluated and re-thought.
* This is the world of the software development team. It's a world in which dates are frozen and requirements are continuosly changing.

### The analysis phase

* We should be sizing the project and doing basic feasibility and human resources projections. We should be ensuring that the schedule is achievable.

### The design phase

* Software design is where we split the project up into modules and design the interfaces between those modules. It's also where we consider how many teams we need and what the connections between those teams ought to be. In general, we are expected to refine the schedule in order to produce a realistically acievable implementation plan.

### The implementation phase

* It's completly unambiguos what we are doing during the Implementation phase. We are coding. And we'd better be coding like mad banshees too, because we've already blown four months of this project.
* Meanwhile, the requirements are still changing on us.

### The death march phase

* Customers aree angry. Stakeholders are angry. The pressure mounts. Overtime soars. People quit. It's hell.
* We promise ourselves that we will never do another project like this. Next time we'll do it right.

### A better way

* An agile project begins with analysis, but it's an analysis that never ends.
* You set the deadline. Remember, the first thing you know is *The Date*. We subdivide that time into regular increments called iterations or sprints.

* The size of an iteration is typicallly one or two weeks. I prefer one week because too much can go wrong in two weeks.
