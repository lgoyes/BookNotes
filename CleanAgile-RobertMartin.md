## 1. Introduction to Agile

* In febreuary 2001, a group of 17 software experts gathered in Snowbird, Utah, to create a manifesto that introduced a more effective, lighter-weight, approach to develop software.
* Once a movement becomes popular, the name of that movement gets blurred through missunderstanding and usurpation.

### History of Agile

* The idea of choosing small intermediate goals and measuring the progress, after each is just too intuitive, and too human, to be considered any kind of a revolution.
* In "scientific management", managers use scientific techniques to ascertain the best procedures for accomplishing a goal and then direct all subordinates to follow their plan to the letter. There is a big up-front planning followed by careful detailed implementation.
* Pro-Agile took short reactive steps that were measured and refined in order to stagger, in a direct random walk, toward a good outcome.
* Scientific management deferred action until a thoroung analysis and resulting detailed plan had been created.
* Pre-agile worked well for projects that enjoyed a low cost of chnage, and solved partially defined projects with informally specified goals.
* Scientific management worked best for projects that suffered a high cost of change and solve very well-defined problems with extremely specific goals.
* Waterfall was a logical descendant of scientific management. It was all about doing a thorough analysis, making a detailed plan, and then executing the plan to completion.
* Waterfall began to dominate the way we thought.
* It dominated, but it didn't work. For the next thirty years, we tried to get that analysis and design right. But everytime we thought we had it, it slipped through our fingers during the implementation phase. All our months of careful planning were made irrelevant by the inveitable mod dash.
* How could we thoroughly analyzing the problem, carefully designing a solution, and then implmenting that design, fail so spectacularly over and over again? It was inconceivable that the problem lay in the strategy. It had to lie with us.
* Agile manifesto:
    * **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools.
    * **Working software** over comprehensive documentation.
    * **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation.
    * **Responding to change** over following a plan.

### Agile Overview

* how do you manage a sotware projects?
    * Hope and prayer
    * Those who don't have faith, often fall back on motivational techniques such as enforcing dates with whips, chains, boiling oil, and pictures of people climbing rocks and seagulls flying over the ocean.
* These approaches almost universally lead to the characteristic symptoms of software management:
    * Development teams who are always late despite working too much overtime.
    * Teams who produce products of poor quality that don't come close to meeting the needs of the customer.
